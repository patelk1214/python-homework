In each Jupyter Notebook, same custom LSTM RNN architecture model is build. As required in HW, one notebook the model is fitted with FNG values. 
In the second notebook, the modle is fitted with closing prices data.

1) Which model has a lower loss?
Ans - Model with with Closing prices has lower loss. 

    Evaluation of Model with with Closing prices: 
    5/5 [==============================] - 1s 3ms/step - loss: 0.0601

    0.060083068907260895

    Evaluation of Model with with FNG values
    5/5 [==============================] - 1s 0s/step - loss: 0.1142

    0.11415214836597443

2) Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
Ans = The model with the CLosing Price data trackes the actual clsoing price better than the model with FNG values. Though the actual values were having 
different but the Trend was same between actual and predicted values from model fitted with closing prices. 

3) Which window size works best for the model?
Ans - window size between 30-35 wroks well with the model fitted with Closing price. For FNG values model, wondow size 30 gave better results.

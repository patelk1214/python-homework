Conclusion for followigng two HW excercises. 

1) Time-Series Forecasting: 
Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?

Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?

Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?

    1. Based on the 5 days forecast the Yen futures seems to go higher from current level. Hence it make sesne to go long on yen futures with stop loss ofcourse (not mentioned stop loss levels here)

    2. As per garch model forecast the Volatility expected to go up slighly (from 7.475 to 7.65). hence the risk of yen is expected to increase.

	3. Yes, based on Arima and Garch model implementation, and p values and AIC numbers for ARMA(2.1) model the forecast seems quite reasonable for short term. It can be used for trading.


2) Linear Regression Forecasting: 

The Model perfom better on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data as the RMSE is lower in case of Out-of-sample data.
